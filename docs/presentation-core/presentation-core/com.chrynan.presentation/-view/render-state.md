# renderState

[common]\
abstract val [renderState](render-state.md): [S](index.md)?

The currently rendered [State](../-state/index.md). This property could briefly differ from the [Presenter.currentState](../-presenter/current-state.md) until that state is provided to the render function and is rendered to display.
