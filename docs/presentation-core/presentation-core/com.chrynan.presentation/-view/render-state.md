# renderState

[common]\
abstract val [renderState](render-state.md): [S](index.md)?

The currently rendered [State](../-state/index.md). This property could briefly differ from the [ViewModel.currentState](../-view-model/current-state.md) until that state is observed by this [View](index.md) and is rendered to display.
