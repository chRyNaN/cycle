# intent

[common]\
abstract fun [intent](intent.md)(to: [I](index.md))

Emits the provided [to](../-intent/index.md) value to trigger an action, that may eventually result in a new [State](../-state/index.md) being rendered. These can be caused by user input events (clicks, scrolls, etc.) or by other means.
