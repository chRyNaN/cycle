# renderState

[android]\
open override val [renderState](render-state.md): [STATE](index.md)?

The currently rendered [State](../../../../presentation-core/presentation-core/com.chrynan.presentation/-state/index.md). This property could briefly differ from the [Presenter.currentState](../../../../presentation-core/presentation-core/com.chrynan.presentation/-presenter/current-state.md) until that state is provided to the render function and is rendered to display.
