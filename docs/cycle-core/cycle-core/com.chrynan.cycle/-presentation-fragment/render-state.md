# renderState

[android]\
override var [renderState](render-state.md): [State](index.md)?

The currently rendered [State](index.md). This property could briefly differ from the [ViewModel.currentState](../../../../cycle-core/cycle-core/com.chrynan.cycle/-view-model/current-state.md) until that state is observed by this [View](../../../../cycle-core/cycle-core/com.chrynan.cycle/-view/index.md) and is rendered to display.
